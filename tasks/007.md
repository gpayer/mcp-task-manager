Create a plugin that integrates task manager MCP with superpowers skills.

**Design:** `docs/plans/2025-12-31-superpowers-workflow-plugin-design.md`

## Summary
- Plugin adds `superpowers-workflow` skill and `/execute-all` command
- Parent tasks get decomposed into subtasks during planning phase
- Execution uses superpowers:subagent-driven-development with task manager as storage backend
- Subtasks hold full implementation specs (no separate plan files)
