Add new MCP tools in `internal/tools/`: `add_relation(source, type, target)` and `remove_relation(source, type, target)`. Update existing tools: `get_task` response includes relations and derived `blocked` field. `list_tasks` response includes `blocked` field per task. `get_next_task` uses updated NextTodo (already filtered in index layer). `start_task` uses blocking guard from service. `delete_task` uses cascade from service. Register new tools in `tools.go`.
