Tasks can have subtasks, allowing complicated tasks to be broken down into smaller, more manageable steps:

* A task is considered done when all of its subtasks are done
* All task management commands should handle subtasks:
  - `create_task` - ability to create subtasks under a parent
  - `update_task` - update subtask fields
  - `list_tasks` - show subtasks (nested or filtered)
  - `get_task` - include subtasks in response
  - `delete_task` - handle subtask deletion (cascade or prevent)
* All workflow commands should handle subtasks:
  - `get_next_task` - consider subtask status
  - `start_task` / `complete_task` - work with subtasks
  - Auto-complete parent when all subtasks are done
