Add CLI subcommands to mcp-task-manager so it can be used as a standalone command-line tool:

* Subcommands: `list`, `get`, `delete`, `help`, etc.
  - Example: `mcp-task-manager list`, `mcp-task-manager get <task-id>`
* Every subcommand should have a `--help` option
* If called without any subcommand, it should run normally as an MCP server (backwards compatible)
