Update the superpowers-workflow skill (`skills/superpowers-workflow/SKILL.md`) to specify that all changes to task markdown files in the `tasks/` directory must be committed to git as the last step of the workflow.

This ensures that task state changes are always version-controlled after workflow completion.
