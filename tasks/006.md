## Problem

The CLI `get` command doesn't show subtasks for parent tasks.

## Root Cause

`cmdGet` in `commands.go` uses `svc.Get(id)` which only returns the task itself. The MCP `get_task` tool was updated to use `svc.GetWithSubtasks(id)` but the CLI was not updated.

## Expected Behavior

When getting a parent task, subtasks should be displayed (similar to how MCP get_task includes them in the response).

## Solution

Update `cmdGet` to use `svc.GetWithSubtasks()` and update `FormatTaskDetail` to display subtasks.
